$ vitest run
Warning: A vi.mock("node:child_process") call in "~/Documents/GitHub/spec-runner/.git/specrunner-worktrees/agent-tool-constraints-research-2c02060b/tests/git-remote.test.ts" is not at the top level of the module. Although it appears nested, it will be hoisted and executed before any tests run. Move it to the top level to reflect its actual execution order. This will become an error in a future version.
