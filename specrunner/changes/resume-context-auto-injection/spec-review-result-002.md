# Spec Review Result

<!-- FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (machine-parsed):
- The verdict line MUST appear before the Findings table.
- verdict line format (exact): `- **verdict**: <value>` at the start of a line
- Valid verdict values: approved | needs-fix | escalation
  - approved:    specification is complete, consistent, and ready for implementation
  - needs-fix:   specification has issues that must be resolved before implementation
  - escalation:  unresolvable conflicts, missing context, or requires human judgment
- Findings table MUST have exactly 6 columns in this order:
  # | Severity | Category | File | Description | How to Fix
- Valid Severity values (uppercase): CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
  - CRITICAL: production outage, data loss, security breach
  - HIGH:     functional failure, clear bug, no workaround — blocks approval
  - MEDIUM:   quality degradation, maintainability issue, future risk
  - LOW:      informational, style, minor improvement
- If no findings, write a table row with "None" or omit the table body.
**Verdict blocking rules (derived by CLI from the reported findings)**:
- `decision-needed` ≥ 1 → `escalation`（request-review では `needs-discussion`）
- `critical` または `high` ≥ 1 → `needs-fix`
- それ以外 → `approved`

markdown の verdict 行と報告された findings が矛盾した場合、**findings 由来の導出が優先**されます。verdict 行は人間向けの要約であり、機械ルーティングには使用されません。

- **verdict**: approved

## Findings

| # | Severity | Category | File | Description | How to Fix |
|---|----------|----------|------|-------------|------------|
| None | - | - | - | No blocking findings. The updated spec resolves the prior lifecycle issue by requiring a deterministic `resumeContext` snapshot to be captured before `resumePoint` is cleared and handed to `StepExecutor`. The design keeps the adapter-facing `resumePrompt` contract unchanged, makes human prose supplemental, specifies deterministic state-only formatting, and adds executor-level tests for plain resume, human-prompt resume, and first-run non-injection. Security review found no new authentication or authorization surface; the design avoids network, filesystem, git, clock, and LLM dependencies in the builder and does not parse large findings content into the prompt. | Proceed to implementation. During implementation, keep state-derived values rendered under stable labels and avoid treating human `resumePrompt` as trusted control data beyond the existing explicit operator-supplied prompt path. |
